Sherlock Scenario
Our SIEM alerted us to a suspicious logon event which needs to be looked at immediately . The alert details were that the IP Address and the Source Workstation name were a mismatch.
You are provided a network capture and event logs from the surrounding time around the incident timeframe. Corelate the given evidence and report back to your SOC Manager.

**Use smb2.acct in wireshark to display all smb2 packets linked to a user/session**

Task 1

What is the IP Address for Forela-Wkstn001?

[172.17.79.129]

Task 2

What is the IP Address for Forela-Wkstn002?

[172.17.79.136]

Task 3

What is the username of the account whose hash was stolen by attacker?
I was able to find this via the SMB2 packets displayed. This was through manual searching.
I could parse packets faster by searching for smb2 and specifically "smb2.acct".

Task 4

What is the IP Address of Unknown Device used by the attacker to intercept credentials?
This is where I pivoted to the Security Log, using Eric Zimmerman's EvtxECmd.exe to parse the logs into a CSV format. (Using Powershell)
CMD: .\EvtxECmd.exe -f "C:\Users\plat\Downloads\Reaper\Security.evtx" --csv $HOME\OneDrive\Desktop --csvf security.csv

Then using TimelineExplorer.exe, we can visualise this csv table in a neat table format. From there, I was able to discover the 'Remote Host' column.
This lead to the answer below.
[172.17.79.135]

Task 5

What was the fileshare navigated by the victim user account?
Since we are aware of when the attacker first authenticated as our victim in frame 1256 using smb.acct, we can parse the packets using the command below.
smb2 && _ws.col.info matches "(?i) file" && frame.number > 1256
This gave us the share path of the file below.

Task 6

What is the source port used to logon to target workstation using the compromised account?
Using our beautifully parsed security event logs we performed in task 4, we are able to visualise the port and IP on the authentication under the 'Remote Host' column.
[40252]

Task 7

What is the Logon ID for the malicious session?
Following our table, we can visualise the payload under column 'Payload3' to see the LogonID.
[0x64A799]

Task 8

The detection was based on the mismatch of hostname and the assigned IP Address. What is the workstation name and the source IP Address from which the malicious logon occur?
Visualised under the Remote Host column.
Remote Host [FORELA-WKSTN002 (172.17.79.135)]

Task 9

At what UTC time did the the malicious logon happen?
Still in our beautifully formatted security event logs.
Time Created
[2024-07-31 04:55:16]

Task 10

What is the share Name accessed as part of the authentication process by the malicious tool used by the attacker?
Visualisable in the full payload column of our formatted security event logs:
[\\*\IPC$]
