Sherlock Scenario
Your security team must always be up-to-date and aware of the threats targeting organizations in your industry. 
As you begin your journey as a Threat Intelligence Intern, equipped with some SOC experience, 
your manager has assigned you a task to test your research skills and how effectively you can leverage the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 
* Conduct thorough research on Volt Typhoon. * 
Use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map adversary behavior and tactics into actionable insights. Impress your manager with your assessment, showcasing your passion for threat intelligence.


Task 1

Based on MITRE's sources, since when has Volt Typhoon been active?
Article: https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017/
[2021]

Task 2

MITRE identifies two OS credential dumping techniques used by Volt Typhoon. One is LSASS Memory access (T1003.001). What is the Attack ID for the other technique?
Same Article.
[T1003.003]

Task 3

Which database is targeted by the credential dumping technique mentioned earlier?
https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/003/
[Active Directory]

Task 4

Which registry hive is required by the threat actor to decrypt the targeted database?
Same article:
[SYSTEM]

Task 5

During the June 2024 campaign, an adversary was observed using a Zero-Day Exploitation targeting Versa Director. What is the name of the Software/Malware that was used?
https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0039/ -> Conducted by Volt Typhoon
[VersaMem]

Task 6

According to the Server Software Component, what type of malware was observed?
Same article:

Task 7

Where did the malware store captured credentials?
https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1154/
[/tmp/.temp.data]

Task 8

According to MITRE’s reference, a Lumen/Black Lotus Labs article(Taking The Crossroads: The Versa Director Zero-Day Exploitaiton.), what was the filename of the first malware version scanned on VirusTotal?
https://blog.lumen.com/uncovering-the-versa-director-zero-day-exploitation/
[VersaTest.png]

Task 9

What is the SHA256 hash of the file?
Same article:
[4bcedac20a75e8f8833f4725adfc87577c32990c3783bf6c743f14599a176c37]

Task 10

According to VirusTotal, what is the file type of the malware?
Same article: Figure 5: Screenshot showing code from VersaMem that identifies the threat-actor artifact name of the JAR file as “Director_tomcat_memShell” and the bundle name as “VersaTest.” 
[JAR]

Task 11

What is the 'Created by' value in the file's Manifest according to VirusTotal?
https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4bcedac20a75e8f8833f4725adfc87577c32990c3783bf6c743f14599a176c37/details
[Apache Maven 3.6.0]

Task 12

What is the CVE identifier associated with this malware and vulnerability?
same article:
[cve-2024-39717]

Task 13

According to the CISA document(https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/aa24-038a_csa_prc_state_sponsored_actors_compromise_us_critical_infrastructure_3.pdf) referenced by MITRE, what is the primary strategy Volt Typhoon uses for defense evasion?
Article quoted above in task. -> Defense Evasion Page 10
Volt Typhoon has strong operational security. Their actors primarily use LOTL for defense evasion 
[TA0005], which allows them to camouflage their malicious activity with typical system and network 
behavior, potentially circumventing simplistic endpoint security capabilities. For more information, see 
joint guide Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques.
[LOTL]

Task 14

In the CISA document, which file name is associated with the command potentially used to analyze logon patterns by Volt Typhoon?
To quote them:
Capturing successful logon events [T1654]. 
o Specifically, in one incident, analysis of the PowerShell console history of a domain 
controller indicated that security event logs were directed to a file named user.dat, as 
evidenced by the executed command Get-EventLog security -instanceid 4624 
after [year-month-date] | fl * | Out-File 
'C:\users\public\documents\user.dat'. This indicates the group's specific interest in 
capturing successful logon events (event ID 4624) to analyze user authentication patterns 
within the network. Additionally, file system analysis, specifically of the Master File Table 
(MFT), uncovered evidence of a separate file, systeminfo.dat, which was created in 
C:\Users\Public\Documents but subsequently deleted [T1070.004]. The presence of 
these activities suggests a methodical approach by Volt Typhoon actors in collecting and 
then possibly removing traces of sensitive log information from the compromised system.
[C:\users\public\documents\user.dat]
