Sherlock Scenario
In this Sherlock, you will familiarize yourself with Sysmon logs and various useful EventIDs for identifying and analyzing malicious activities on a Windows system. 
Palo Alto's Unit42 recently conducted research on an UltraVNC campaign, wherein attackers utilized a backdoored version of UltraVNC to maintain access to systems. 
This lab is inspired by that campaign and guides participants through the initial access stage of the campaign.

**To pretense this, I've changed the logs from a .evtx to a csv using Eric Zimmermans EvtxeCmd ->  .\EvtxECmd.exe -f 'C:\Users\platRGB\Downloads\unit422\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon-Operational.evtx' --csv "$HOME\Downloads\unit422" --csvf unit42.csv
**Also to note, the use of -f is for file, -d is an entire directory of '.evtx'.


Task 1

How many Event logs are there with Event ID 11?
This was easy, filter Event Id column for 11.
[56]

Task 2

Whenever a process is created in memory, an event with Event ID 1 is recorded with details such as command line, hashes, process path, parent process path, etc. This information is very useful for an analyst because it allows us to see all programs executed on a system, which means we can spot any malicious processes being executed. What is the malicious process that infected the victim's system?
Using this pre-amble, we can filter for Event ID 1. This looks very odd.

Task 3

Which Cloud drive was used to distribute the malware?
This is the where the event logs start for sysmon, in which the event in this instance is 'DNSEvent' which is right before the files were downloaded.

Task 4

For many of the files it wrote to disk, the initial malicious file used a defense evasion technique called Time Stomping, where the file creation date is changed to make it appear older and blend in with other files. What was the timestamp changed to for the PDF file?
This is where a process has changed the file creation time to make it look older, event ID 2, and can be mapped in such a way.

Task 5

The malicious file dropped a few files on disk. Where was "once.cmd" created on disk? Please answer with the full path along with the filename.
Under file creation.
[C:\Users\CyberJunkie\AppData\Roaming\Photo and Fax Vn\Photo and vn 1.1.2\install\F97891C\WindowsVolume\Games\once.cmd]

Task 6

The malicious file attempted to reach a dummy domain, most likely to check the internet connection status. What domain name did it try to connect to?
Another 'DNS query event' found for this domain.
[www.example.com]

Task 7

Which IP address did the malicious process try to reach out to?
This is regarding the network connection event packets. This is event ID 3 in the sysmon evtx logs.
[93.184.216.34]

Task 8

The malicious process terminated itself after infecting the PC with a backdoored variant of UltraVNC. When did the process terminate itself?
'Process Terminated' - Event ID: 5
