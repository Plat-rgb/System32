Sherlock Scenario
In this Sherlock, you will become acquainted with MFT (Master File Table) forensics. You will be introduced to well-known tools and methodologies for analyzing MFT artifacts to identify malicious activity. During our analysis, you will utilize the MFTECmd tool to parse the provided MFT file, TimeLine Explorer to open and analyze the results from the parsed MFT, and a Hex editor to recover file contents from the MFT.

Task 1

Simon Stark was targeted by attackers on February 13. He downloaded a ZIP file from a link received in an email. What was the name of the ZIP file he downloaded from the link?
After the successful conversion, I am able to directly search the extensions column for '.zip'.
[Stage-20240213T093324Z-001.zip]

Task 2

Examine the Zone Identifier contents for the initially downloaded ZIP file. This field reveals the HostUrl from where the file was downloaded, serving as a valuable Indicator of Compromise (IOC) in our investigation/analysis. What is the full Host URL from where this ZIP file was downloaded?
Highly interesting and useful to note.

Task 3

What is the full path and name of the malicious file that executed malicious code and connected to a C2 server?
This one was a little trickier, what I was able to do was reduce the extensive noise within the file by filtering out rows of the MFT, where they were not created on that day/hour. 
I then continued filtering, adding some of the details from the parent path to understand if the zip had created/executed files from within itself.
That is where I found this.

Task 4

Analyze the $Created0x30 timestamp for the previously identified file. When was this file created on disk?
Following the timestamp column for this file.

Task 5

Finding the hex offset of an MFT record is beneficial in many investigative scenarios. Find the hex offset of the stager file from Question 3.
Because of MFT records being 1024 in size, you multiply the 'EntryNumber' by this, and convert to HEX.
23436*1024=23998464
Convert to HEX

Task 6

Each MFT record is 1024 bytes in size. If a file on disk has smaller size than 1024 bytes, they can be stored directly on MFT File itself. These are called MFT Resident files. During Windows File system Investigation, its crucial to look for any malicious/suspicious files that may be resident in MFT. This way we can find contents of malicious files/scripts. Find the contents of The malicious stager identified in Question3 and answer with the C2 IP and port.
This required a look at the HxD code to understand the file. It appeared the file was in plain text. You can see the BAT file insides copied below:
