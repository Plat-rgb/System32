Sherlock Scenario
Forela's domain controller is under attack. The Domain Administrator account is believed to be compromised, and it is suspected that the threat actor dumped the NTDS.dit database on the DC. We just received an alert of vssadmin being used on the DC, since this is not part of the routine schedule we have good reason to believe that the attacker abused this LOLBIN utility to get the Domain environment's crown jewel. Perform some analysis on provided artifacts for a quick triage and if possible kick the attacker as early as possible.

Task 1

Attackers can abuse the vssadmin utility to create volume shadow snapshots and then extract sensitive files like NTDS.dit to bypass security mechanisms. Identify the time when the Volume Shadow Copy service entered a running state.
Service started or stopped			Name: Volume Shadow Copy | Volume Shadow Copy
Service Control Manager - Event ID 7036
[2024-05-14 03:42:16]

Task 2

When a volume shadow snapshot is created, the Volume shadow copy service validates the privileges using the Machine account and enumerates User groups. Find the two user groups the volume shadow copy process queries and the machine account that did it.
A security-enabled local group membership was enumerated - event id 4799 - Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing
[Administrators, Backup Operators, DC01$]

Task 3

Identify the Process ID (in Decimal) of the volume shadow copy service process.
Same event log - callerprocessid
0x1190 convert to decimal.
[4496]

Task 4

Find the assigned Volume ID/GUID value to the Shadow copy snapshot when it was mounted.
Found and part of the Microsoft-Windows-Ntfs logs.
{06c4a997-cca8-11ed-a90f-000c295644f9}

Task 5

Identify the full path of the dumped NTDS database on disk.
Switching over to the MFT dump, I searched directly for NFT and found it below.
[C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\backup_sync_Dc\Ntds.dit]

Task 6

When was newly dumped ntds.dit created on disk?
Same event log.
[2024-05-14 03:44:22]

Task 7

A registry hive was also dumped alongside the NTDS database. Which registry hive was dumped and what is its file size in bytes?
This was within the same directory, and happened in a relevatively similar timeframe.
[SYSTEM, 17563648]
