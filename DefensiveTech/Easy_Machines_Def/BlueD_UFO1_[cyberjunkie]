Sherlock Scenario
Being in the ICS Industry, your security team always needs to be up to date and should be aware of the threats targeting organizations in your industry. 
You just started as a Threat intelligence intern, with a bit of SOC experience. Your manager has given you a task to test your skills in research and how well can you utilize Mitre Att&ck to your advantage. 
Do your research on Sandworm Team, also known as BlackEnergy Group and APT44. 
Utilize Mitre ATT&CK to understand how to map adversary behavior and tactics in actionable form. Smash the assessment and impress your manager as Threat intelligence is your passion.


Task 1

According to the sources cited by Mitre, in what year did the Sandworm Team begin operations?
https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/
[2009]

Task 2

Mitre notes two credential access techniques used by the BlackEnergy group to access several hosts in the compromised network during a 2016 campaign against the Ukrainian electric power grid. One is LSASS Memory access (T1003.001). What is the Attack ID for the other?
https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator//#layerURL=https%3A%2F%2Fattack.mitre.org%2Fcampaigns%2FC0025%2FC0025-enterprise-layer.json -> Credential Access
[T1110]

Task 3

During the 2016 campaign, the adversary was observed using a VBS script during their operations. What is the name of the VBS file?
https://www.dragos.com/wp-content/uploads/CRASHOVERRIDE2018.pdf
After extensive environmental survey activity and verifying access in the 12 to 15 December 2016 time 
period, ELECTRUM proceeds to push the CRASHOVERRIDE framework to target hosts around 16 
December 2016. After verifying connectivity and other operations, on 17 December ELECTRUM begins 
pushing out malicious software to hosts connected to the server machines using a BAT file calling two, 
unrecovered VBS scripts. Although the exact content of the VBS items is unknown, review of the BAT 
indicates they copy files to remote hosts and then verify via a directory listing.

https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/03/blackenergy-sshbeardoor-details-2015-attacks-ukrainian-news-media-electric-industry/
[6789]

Task 14

The Sandworm Team has been assisted by another APT group on various operations. Which specific group is known to have collaborated with them?
https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/apt44-unearthing-sandworm.pdf
Mandiant had previously attributed XakNet and CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn activity to APT28 based on a case of cohabitation where APT28 and APT44 were both operating in the same 
network. Re-analysis of the relevant incident data allowed us to parse the two sets of overlapping activity and link the CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn-associated intrusion activity to APT44 
with high confidence

[APT28]
