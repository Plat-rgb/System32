Sherlock Scenario
The incident happened around 4:30 PM on Friday, "The Last day of the week" at the Accounts/Marketing department of "Finance XYZ" company. 
There weren't many people in the department, and the remaining were not paying much attention to their surroundings as they were getting ready to head home. 
After the weekend on Monday while reviewing the security cam footage member of an IT team saw "Eddie" a new intern in the Accounts/Marketing department, 
plugging a USB into an unauthorized computer (containing sensitive financial and marketing documents), interacting with computer and unplugging the USB before heading out. 
As the incident happened 2 days ago, and not having enough knowledge of what Eddie did the security team use caution while asking around and gathering intel to avoid causing suspicion. 
The only information they were able to find out was that Eddie had a "Toshiba" USB. 
You are provided with a partial image of the â€œunauthorized computer" as well as a list of important documents, to investigate what he did and if he stole something sensitive or not?


** I had to install and use a new tool called 'FTK Imager'. It took some time to understand the structure but I am now able to visualise the file structure it represents.
** Part of the image had some registry keys associated, which I exported using '*right-click* export files' on the config file, and opened this in registry explorer from Zimmerman's tools.
** Add this my toolset, very cool learning involved: https://thumbcacheviewer.github.io/

              ---------------------------------------------------------------------
              | What does ActiveTimeBias mean?
              | It's the offset from UTC in minutes.
              |  
              | Windows uses it to determine local time = UTC - ActiveTimeBias.
              | 
              | Why is it negative for UTC+05:00?
              | If your timezone is UTC+05:00, then:
              |
              | You are 5 hours ahead of UTC.
              | 
              | To go from UTC to your local time, you'd do:
              | Local time = UTC + 300 minutes.
              |  
              | But Windows does:
              |
              | Local time = UTC - ActiveTimeBias
              | So to get the same result,
              | you need: ActiveTimeBias = -300.
              | 
              | Hence, ActiveTimeBias = -300 is correct for UTC+05:00.

How many USB storage devices were attached to this host in total?
    I first went around ControlSet001/Enum/STORAGE, ControlSet001/Enum/USB, & MountedDevices. Whilst each may have been helpful, none had as much help as: 
    ControlSet001/Enum/USBSTOR which allows me to visualise the information more clearly.
    With that in mind, I was able to extract the information from the table, visualised below:
    | Timestamp           | Manufacturer | Title              | Version  | Serial Number              | Device Name                         | Disk Id                                | Installed           | First Installed     | Last Connected      | Last Removed        |

    As you can see above, there are numerable devices detected. At first glance there may look to be 7 devices connected, however, a quick google search found that the matching serial numbers of the first 4 devices belonged to
    a USB hub device and not actual USBs, in which the hub would visualise each of its slots within the registry. 
    This left the Kingston, TOSHIBA, and VendorCo USB devices.

Which folder did he copy to the USB?
    I spent way too much time on this question and was overthinking the answer. I searched through the registry explorer and pieces of the ad1 image before stumbling upon the answer.
    This is a combination of the .txt file sent with the ad1 image initially. Txt information is displayed below:

There were subfolders in the folder that was copied. What is the name of the first subfolder? (Alphabetically)
    Continuing to use the information above, this can be done within FTK Imager.

What was the drive letter of the USB?
Whilst this is usually mapped within the 'MountedDevices' of the registry which includes previously connected devices, I found this information back at the recent .lnk files hex data.
This was because the docx and xlsx were opened from the USB rather than the documents section where it was originally contained.

I hope we can find some more evidence to tie this all together. What is Eddie's last name?
This took way too long to find and I don't find the hint as helpful. After deep scouring and learning within the FTK imager I came across the thumbcaches.
I used https://thumbcacheviewer.github.io/ after downloading them to carve out the images of the file previews they represented.
