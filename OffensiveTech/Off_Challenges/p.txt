Context: There's a new trend of an application that generates a spooky name for you. Users of that application later discovered that their real names were also magically changed, causing havoc in their life. Could you help bring down this application?

Knowledge Gain: Here I learned more about Server-Side Template Injection where RCE can be achieved with full-control of the server.
To understand more about, I used some of the most common example:
${{<%[%'"}}%\.

From here we can potentially identify the engine via this method:
${7*7}
   ├── [a{*comment*}b] Smarty (vulnerable)
   │       ├── ${"z".join("ab")} → Mako (vulnerable)
   |       └── Unknown (vulnerability status uncertain)
   └── [{{7*7}}]
           ├── non-vulnerable
           ├── {{7*'7'}} → Twig (vulnerable)
           ├── {{7*'7'}} → Jinja2 (vulnerable)
           └── Unknown (vulnerability status uncertain)

Using this method, the most common example caused the server to crash, the first one through the engine was successful, additionally ${"z".join("ab")} was also successful.
I was able to replicate results using the $ symbol across different commands.
