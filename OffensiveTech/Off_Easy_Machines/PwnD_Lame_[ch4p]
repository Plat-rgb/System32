How many of the nmap top 1000 TCP ports are open on the remote host?
    nmap -sS --top-ports 1000 10.10.10.10 -vv was able to tell me the top open ports
    [4]

What version of VSFTPd is running on Lame?
    nmap -p21 10.10.10.10 --script banner got the version number
    [2.3.4]

There is a famous backdoor in VSFTPd version 2.3.4, and a Metasploit module to exploit it. Does that exploit work here?
    It had been a while since using metasploit but I summoned it by using msfconsole.
    I then typed 'help' to understand how I could search for the backdoor.
    I found the term 'search' and used this in combination with backdoor to find a large number of results.
    Then I typed search -help to understand what depth I could filter for.
    I then was able to refine the search down by using 'search backdoor FTP'
    I located the resource and typed 'use 1' to get started.
    I then went through the options, setting the desired target host and typed exploit.
    When the connection was created, we found that it required a password 'USER: 331 Please specify the password.' which we did not have, leaving this exploit unsuccessful.
    [No].

What version of Samba is running on Lame? Give the numbers up to but not including "-Debian".
    nmap --script=smb-os-discovery -p445 10.10.10.10 gave me the OS version.
    [3.0.20]

What 2007 CVE allows for remote code execution in this version of Samba via shell metacharacters involving the SamrChangePassword function when the "username map script" option is enabled in smb.conf?


Exploiting CVE-2007-2447 returns a shell as which user?
    When I had exploited the machine by setting the options (RHOST,RPORT,LHOST,LPORT) and commanding 'exploit', I was then able to command 'whoami' which returned the user I was on the machine.
    [root]

Submit the flag located in the makis user's home directory.
    This was easy by jumping directories to the user's home directory and 'cat flag.txt'
    [29644d58e77f9934b0ea0bd130a8970c]

Submit the flag located in root's home directory.
    Since I am root, this flag was an easy change in directories.
    cd ~
    cat root.txt

We'll explore a bit beyond just getting a root shell on the box. While the official writeup doesn't cover this, you can look at 0xdf's write-up for more details. With a root shell, we can look at why the VSFTPd exploit failed. Our initial nmap scan showed four open TCP ports. Running netstat -tnlp shows many more ports listening, including ones on 0.0.0.0 and the boxes external IP, so they should be accessible. What must be blocking connection to these ports?
    From understanding this could be because of many items, one of which would be a:
    'firewall'

When the VSFTPd backdoor is trigger, what port starts listening?
    Looking at the documentation, it opens up the backdoor on port
    [6200]

When the VSFTPd backdoor is triggered, does port 6200 start listening on Lame?
    That is what the documentation states and is verified.
    [yes]
