*** ADD TITANIC.HTB to /etc/hosts to resolve it locally ***


When using the book functionality of the website, it returns a ticket which we intercepted using burp-suite, and found http://titanic.htb/download?ticket=random_id.json

Local File Inclusion (LFI)
We can attempt the above by switching out the random_id for ../../../etc/passwd which ended up successful.
Extracting /etc/hosts also comes up with successful and we find an additional domain 'dev.'


*** ADD DEV.TITANIC.HTB to /etc/hosts AS WELL ***

Delving into dev. we find gitea and documentation relating to its configuration.
